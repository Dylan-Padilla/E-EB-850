## [Definition of niche]{style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;font-weight:normal;color:purple"} {background=''}

<br>

The ecological niche has been defined as multidimensional hypervolume space within which a species can persist 

<br>

- Grinnellian: Related to non-interactive broad-scale environmental variables

- Eltonian: Focuses on biotic interactions


## [Objectives]{style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;font-weight:normal;color:purple"} {background=''}

<br>

- To describe the general structure of squamate climatic niche space
- To test for variation in rates of climatic niche evolution, both among clades and over time
- To assess the extent to which niche evolution corresponded to large-scale climatic changes over the course of their history

## [The premise]{style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;font-weight:normal;color:purple"} {background=''}

<br>

-  The extent to which climate influences species distribution is greater in ectotherms than inendotherms

- That may have led to a stronger effect of historical climate change on squamate climatic niche evolution

- Therefore, squamates' climatic niche evolution would be more protracted than that of Primates


## [Results]{style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;font-weight:normal;color:purple"} {background=''}

<br>

The distribution of squamate species on the pPCA ordination plot showed that most species can be found in arid climatic conditions, with relatively low precipitation and high temperatures (figure 1)

<br>

Posterior predictive simulations based on the ARBUTUS method indicated that the BM model showed a poor fit to the dataset for all three PCs

## [Results]{style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;font-weight:normal;color:purple"} {background=''}

<br>

A consistent pattern was uncovered when variation in rates through time was assessed based on DTT plots, indicating higher levels of disparity than expected by chance (figure 3)

## [Results]{style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;font-weight:normal;color:purple"} {background=''}

<br>

The MOTMOT analyses detected frequent variation in rates of climatic niche evolution, both over time and among lineages (figure 5)
